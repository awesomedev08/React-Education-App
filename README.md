# React Education App

This is an education App built with React, Redux, Express.js and MongoDB. Additional technologies include google cloud API and the YouTube API.


### Installation

- Please clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/storatus/react-education-app.git` first. There will be two package.json files, one for the server side and the other for the client side.
This is because server and client have to start at the same time. If you do not have NPM installed, please do so at `https://www.npmjs.com`. This is also a very good project for having a starter platform with react.js and redux.

- In your directory after cloning please do the following:

> Install dependencies for server in `package.json`

```shell
$ cd react-education-app
$ npm install
```
> Install dependencies on client side

```shell
$ cd react-education-app/client
$ npm install
```
